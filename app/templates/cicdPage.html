            Before explaining what Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) means, I would like to give a
            scenario:
            <br><br>
            <i>Imagine going to work, and you had a team where the job was to take a space and design that room as if it
                was a place for students. Every member has their own vision but the issue is that the team has to work on one
                project file. Team members can download and work on their individual assignments but then the project would
                have multiple different files when only one is needed. Then, only committing to one file will result in having
                people redo their parts in one single file or having to wait on someone to finish their part in order to work
                on yours. It becomes a tense task to constantly having to wait on someone, see what was changed, then add your
                own work to the project, check if it doesn't crash or makes sense, then upload for the next person.
            </i>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "container-fluid">
        <p id = "ci">
            That's the essence of Continuous Integration (CI), there is one master copy that everyone involved would download,
            work on their part then merge that to the development branch or the live production branch. The master copy would
            essentially stay as is in case, somewhere along the line there's data loss but the two branches are the ones
            constantly changing through team members.
        </p>
        <p id = "cd">
            Continuous Delivery (CD) is constantly uploading to the branches to get constant and instant feedback or pushing
            the development version of the service to the live production state with ease. The reason that works with relatively
            small issues is that the team would know something went wrong in the development stage and don't have to panic and
            rush to fix something for live production.
        </p>
        <p id="ghActions">
            There is a bit of automation involved in the deployment or to better put it, Actions that the deployment process would
            do and GitHub, in this case, will perform them as told. This application uses 2 actions per workflow, test runs and the
            deployment location (development will go to <abbr title = "We'll use another server on Heroku to demonstrate the difference"
