        <p>Here's the terminologies that I'd be using through this part of the website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Instantiation:</b> A production of an object.</li>
            <li><b>Object:</b> Collection of data and methods that act on those data.</li>
            <li><b>Class:</b> "a sketch" of the code.</li>
            <li><b>Namespace:</b> Collection of current defined names with data about the object that each name references.</li>
            <li><b>Constructor:</b> a method that is called when an object is created.</li>
            <li><b>Fixture:</b> defines the steps and data that constitute the arrangement phase of a test.</li>
            <li><b>Type Hint:</b> a formal solution to statically indicate the type of value within your Python code.</li>
            <li><b>Type Cast:</b> the data types of objects are converted using predefined functions by the user. (Converting)</li>
            <li><b>Unit Test:</b> a software testing method by which individual units of source code are put under various tests
                    to determine whether they are fit for use.</li>
            <li><b>Instance Method:</b> Has unique data of their instance.</li>
            <li><b>Instance Property:</b> a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object.</li>
            <li><b>Static Property:</b> the member is on a class level rather on the instance level.</li>
            <li><b>Static Method:</b> methods that are bound to a class rather than its object.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'll explain about <a href = "oop.html">Object-Orientated Programming or OOP</a> which includes things like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction in on it's own
            page since the subject is important!
            <br>
            If you like, you can click the link above to quickly get to the page.
            <br>
            I'll also be talking about <a href = "solid.html">SOLID and Design Patterns</a> on it's own page as well. Click on the link if you want to jump to that.
