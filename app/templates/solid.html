            <h1>SOLID</h1>
            <p>
                SOLID is programming design philosophy that most programmers use to have programs running smoothly and have the ability to reference errors easily.
                The design philosophy is commonly said to be one of the most flexible and understandable programming practice and is incredibly important to know at least
                for high level jobs, so you can go into the profession without being too lost on why certain code looks a certain way. I'll explain each one and show you an
                example of each one, especially if it's present in the calculator class.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>S</b><i>ingle Responsibility:</i> A class should have one and only one reason to change (Should have one function)</li>
                <li><b>O</b><i>pen Closed:</i> Should be open for extension but closed for modification (So, things should only be added but
	                not changed to make up for the added feature)</li>
                <li><b>L</b><i>iskov Substitution:</i> Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes (Subclass can redefine a function
	                but the end result should not change)</li>
                <li><b>I</b><i>nterface Segregation:</i> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface (So, although
                    some functions are useful to have for all, making more specific ones are better than calling the ones you would think
	                are useful.</li>

            <h3>Single Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                The best way to put and not to sound like Issac Newton here: Each function should have one and only one responsibility. So, let's take a look at our calculator class again:
            </p>
            <img src="../static/images/calcClass.png" id = calcClass>
            <p>
                You are probably wondering why there's two add, subtract and multiply methods when we could just have the result from the first one. Well, you have to think about this a little
                differently; You are creating the first method to store the result within the calculator class, that's one responsibility. The second method is doing the math and moving to the first
                to store and send that result to the user.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h3>Open-Closed</h3>
            <p>
                This is a simple principle to understand: A class should not be constantly modified unless there is a new function, in which the older functions should not be touched in order to compliment
                the new function. So, you can probably see that I didn't include continuous calculating (using the previous result to get a new one) or division. In the calculator class, I shouldn't change
                any of the other functions to accommodate division for the event that I want to add continuous calculations.

        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h3>Liskov Substitution</h3>
            <p>
                This is tricky to explain. The <code>Addition</code> class is a part of <code>Operations</code> class, and then the Operations is used in the Calculator, this is laying out what is happening
                in a programming sense. So while the Addition class is not imported directly to the Calculator class, the function is substituted in the methods used to do the math in the calculator class.
                It's the most basic form of Liskov Substitution but this concept can get really complicated, really fast.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h3>Interface Segregation</h3>
            <p>
                This is going back to the idea of "what if I wanted to have the calculator class have all the functions?" You definitely could, there's no issue with it. However, you will run into the issue
                of where you only want to use subtraction class, but you'll end up getting the sum and product. It's just simply better to only have the operator that you want to use and separate the rest whenever
                you call the calculator function. It'd be a bit more coding here and there, but you'll thank yourself when bugs appear and know where to go to solve them.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h3>Dependency Inversion</h3>
            <p>
                This is exactly what it means, As a parent, you should not be dependent on your child; should be the other way around. This example is more clear in the Operations class:
            </p>
            <img src="../static/images/operClass.png" id = "operClass">
            <p>
                In order for the Operations class to work, it depends on no one; therefore, it's independent. However, the same cannot be said for the Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication all are in
                the Operations class so those classes can't operate without being in their own files. Taking the current structure, those individual operation classes can't be the reason why the Operation
                class works either.
